<!-- About the Project -->

## About the Project

Have you ever had to delete your account on social media and make a new one but lost the people you followed, posts you saved, images you had? Migrate Me To is a web application that seeks to address this problem\*. It allows users to take their information from one account and automate the process of transferring it to another.

Note: This application is still a work in progress.

> `* Subjected to api limitations imposed by the services.`

### What I Learned:

1. Figma design tool to design principles for a web app.
2. Setting up a React project from scratch with webpack, typescript, babel, typescript, jest and cypress.
3. GitHub actions for CI/CD and always keeping it green.
4. The idea of bundling, code-splitting, tree-shaking and compressing bundle files.
5. What monorepos are.
6. How jest works with typescript.
7. A deeper understanding of how typescript emit files and how babel is different from typescript.
8. APIs of various social media app and their rate limits.
9. How Oauth flow works and what role API Key, API Secret and Request Token play in the application.
10. How to make secure API requests with sending a request to the backend instead of storing secret and sensitive values in the frontend.
